This is a sort of a makeshift fire detection system, made with the premise that it detects wildfires in a forest. The assignment specified that I must use a NTC thermistor and a photoresistor for it so I stuck with that and didn't bother with humidity or gas detectors.


I tested the sensors exclusively in the simulator because I did not have a reference sheet of the resistors I actually had on hand, and comparing temperatures with a DHT would have been a little bit inaccurate since they have different builds.


The block diagram was made in MS Paint this time (if it works it works).

This is how the circuit would look like, made in wokwi.
